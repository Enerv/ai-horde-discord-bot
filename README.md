* If endpoint is reachable, requests are processed on your endpoint otherwise requests are moved to AI Horde.
* You can run multiple bots by specifying different configuration files with parameters on the same package.
* For each configuration file, a separate SQLite3 database is created for the bot in the `databases` directory.
* Existing requests in the queue for processing are checked against the API with an interval of at least 4 seconds.

## Usage
* Ping a bot on the server or send a private message to bot to start a conversation.
* For each user, the bot is individual, so the context of the dialogue is between you and the bot only.
